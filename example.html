<h1>Cookieuse</h1>

<p>Cookieuse relies on <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx">implicit consent</a>, by ensuring that all visitors have seen a note about cookies. It can be configured to allows users to refuse the use of non-essential cookies.</p>

<p>Visitors are shown a message overlay (styled by CSS) which tells them that the site uses cookies; the message can be customised, but should have a link to your cookie policy.</p>

<p>If the visitor clicks on the overlay, or if the timer elapses, the overlay will be closed. A cookie is set to remember whether the overlay has been shown to the visitor, and if the cookie is found the overlay will not be shown. The cookie lives for 10 years.</p>

<p>The cookie also stores a state of consent, to remember whether they give consent for cookie use. There are two callbacks available depending on the consent state; consent() and refused().</p>

<p>The consent() callback can be used to add JavaScript which sets cookies, and the refused() callback can be used to remove any cookies which have been set.</p>

<p>The consent state is managed by the <a href="cookiepolicy.html">cookie policy</a> page.</p>

<p>Although the example only uses the two default states (0=refused and 1=consent), you can use your own values; for example, 1=enhancements and 2=advertising. Any non-zero value will equal consent, and the consent cookie value will be passed to the consent() callback.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#" id="reset">Reset the cookie</a> to show the popup on refresh</li>
</ul>

<p id="status"></p>
